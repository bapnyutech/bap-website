		[COVID DISCLAIMER]
		Due to the COVID pandemic, we will be 100% online in order to protect the safety of our volunteers. We will not be able to meet in person as many volunteers are not currently situated in New York. In order to carry out VITA, we will require clients to have video conference capabilities (e.g. a video camera) as well as an internet connection (to call and upload the necessary tax information). If you have filed with NYU VITA (must be at the same location) in the previous year, we may be able to assist you without the need for a video call if you have not changed your method of receiving your tax refund and have not moved or changed address. Our main platforms will be Zoom and Dropbox, and we can only offer limited accommodations to our clients who may have trouble accessing these platforms to protect the information of our clients, such as using email instead of Dropbox.
		<br><br>
		We will also be creating a step by step instructional page that will outline the steps needed for a successful virtual tax filing and the instructions needed to upload the necessary tax documents. Please check back soon. Thank you! 
		<br><br>
		We strive to maintain the quality and integrity of our services and the content of this website. Because of the dynamic nature of the internet and of tax law, however, NYU VITA and affiliated persons give no warranty, expressed or implied, to the accuracy, reliability, relevance, or completeness of information or service provided.<br><br>
		None of the volunteers, officers, college officials, sponsors, and anyone else connected to NYU VITA can be held liable for your use of any information in this website or from services provided. Use any kind of service, advice, or material from NYU VITA at your own risk. No actions of NYU VITA volunteers constitute tax or legal advice.<br><br>
